### This project aims the user who is searching a new home via using Augmented Reality from their Android phones.  

**Tell us what your idea is.   
<br/>

*Around a few months ago, I had started to create the retailer platform that provides user to see sale or rent houses easily. This project contains 2 steps (website and Android mobile app). The website has been finalized with idea that the house owner or retailer can be logged in platform and adding their house through the dashboard. Now, I am developing Android application with AR technology that displaying info about the building user are looking at.* 

*At this project, I will collect the user behaviour and selection through their mobile application. Then, I will implement ML model using Tensorflow for all collected data from my retailer app at server-side. I will create useful ML model that based on information such as user location, home properties (room of home, built year, price, availability of credit) and train the model by using Neural Networks. Then, I will suggest the newly added house based on their criteria even they will not make any selection at application. Just depends of user behaviors on mobile app will guide me to built ML model for this idea.*

**Tell us how you plan on bringing it to life.   
Describe where your project is, how you could use Google’s help in the endeavor, and how you plan on using On-Device ML technology to bring the concept to life. The best submissions have a great idea combined with a concrete path of where you plan on going, which should include:**  
1. **any potential sample code you’ve already written,**
2. **a list of the ways you could use Google’s help,** 
3. **as well as the timeline on how you plan on bringing it to life by May 1, 2020.**
<br/>

**The current status of the project

*Currently, The website of the platform has been finalized with a few minor defects. But at mobile side, I have only been able to create the login and registration pages. The mobile app still didn’t redesign based on collecting data for ML models. Firstly, I will try to make some researches what is the major inputs for user to decide their dream house. Then, I will search some datasets from retail industry that will help house suggestion mechanism. Based on model and user behavior, the API of project will be renewed. You can reach the website platform on line by clicking http://findhouze.com link. Also, you can have main of the project idea http://findhouze.com/how-it-works*

**How Google could help us achieve the goal :**  
• **Assigning experienced mentor for the retailer project**   
• **Free API Token to train ML models through using Google APIs**  
• **Helping us to reach a wide audience**  
• **DataSet about retail platform (if possible)**  
<br/>

**Tell us about you.  
A great idea is just one part of the equation; we also want to learn a bit more about you. Share with us some of your other projects so we can get an idea of how we can assist you with your project.**  
  
*Well, I am Mustafa Celik from Turkey. I’m currently working such as Senior Mobile & Web Developer at TAV Technologies. I've been in the aviation industry latest five years, primarily working in web and mobile development team. I’ve designed and developed core features for aviation Android application using Java. Also, I’ve developed smart TV and smart watch applications on Android device. Based on our company need, the kiosk application has been created too. Before that, I’ve worked with media channels, investors, engineers, and product management to deliver user-friendly and visually appealing mobile applications ensured that content met or exceeded business and client requirements 100% of the time for the Android platform on different projects.* 

*I have created and tested around 20+ Android native applications. The best one was a music app for Android users (2.5M+ downloads to date). Also, have developed investor relation applications for two well-known companies at Turkey. I have own Android applications that was downloaded over 200K times at Google Play Store.*

*About my project, I’ve an experience about neural network project before graduating from univercity. The project was teaching multiplication table with computer by using neural network system. In current company, I am working on airline prediction models to inform passenger about airline-delay.*

*The retail sector has more businesses than any other industry with13.9% of the total according to trustworthiness reports. I want to focus on the real world problem and the the retail industry has several market gaps over the years.*
